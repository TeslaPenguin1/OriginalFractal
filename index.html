				The Menger Sponge is made by dividing a cube into 27 smaller cubes, and removing the cubes at the center and in the middle of the sides. This process is then repeated with the remaining 20 cubes.

				The Sierpinski-Menger Snowflake (left) is made by dividing a cube into 27 equally sized cubes, and removing all the cubes except the corners and the center.
				<br>
				Cantor Dust (right) is made similarly, except it also removes the center sub-cube.

				The Mosely Snowflake is made by either removing the corners and center from a divided cube (the "Light" Mosely, on the left), or by removing just the corners (the "Heavy" Mosely, right).

				Unlike all the other cube fractals, the Jerusalem Cube doesn't cut a cube into 27 parts. Instead, it divides it along a 5x5x5 grid. The cubes forming a cross pattern are removed, and this process is applied to the remaining cubes - the 2x2 sub-cubes at the corners, and the 1x1 sub-cubes at the edges.
